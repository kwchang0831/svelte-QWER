## 🎉 QWER

[QWER](https://github.com/kwchang0831/svelte-QWER) is inspired by [Urara](https://github.com/importantimport/urara), but [QWER](https://github.com/kwchang0831/svelte-QWER)'s internal core was built differently. You can still check my previous blog: [urara.kwchang0831.dev](https://urara.kwchang0831.dev/) that was built by [Urara](https://github.com/importantimport/urara).

It took me about a month or two of my leisure time to develope [QWER](https://github.com/kwchang0831/svelte-QWER). It is also my first [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) + [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) project. I just learned Svelte while developing it.

## 🚧 Current State

[QWER](https://github.com/kwchang0831/svelte-QWER) is currently at pre-alpha stage. I used just-make-it-to-work approach, so a lot of places in the code are NOT optimized at all, ugly as hell. You have been warned. 😉

If you have encountered any issues, please do let me know using [Github's Q&A Discussion board](https://github.com/kwchang0831/svelte-QWER/discussions/categories/q-a).
